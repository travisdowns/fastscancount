Things that could still go faster:

 - Better/proper transpose using SIMD for dynamic_aux
 - Separate out the overshoot calculation from the start/iters transpose, and do it separately with SIMD

Notes on speedup progress:

From a baseline of 3.5 elems per cycle (AVX2 original algo)

Speedup   Speed (e/c)
1.4x             ~2.5   Unrolling and prefetching in the counting loop (most attributable to prefetching)
